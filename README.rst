Welcome to the observatory, a solution for tracking your machine 
learning models.

When working a machine learning model you will find yourself changing 
hyper parameters, code, settings and data all the time. You may even end up 
choosing a different model alltogether.

Because of the high number of changes it is quite hard to keep track of what 
you have tried before.

Questions like:

 - Which model is the best for us?
 - How long did it take to train this model last time?
 - Which hyper parameters did I use?
 
Are quite hard to answer if you're not careful. 
 
Observatory is a simple solution that allows you to keep track of outputs, 
metrics and configuration settings of your models.
